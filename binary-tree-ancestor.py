Question: Find the ancestors of a node in a binary tree

Algorithm: :bulb: :rocket:
0. Pre order traversal - check current node and then traverse left and right!
1. Detailed explanation with picture http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/83567/finding-common-ancestor-in-a-binary-tree
2. Check count (nonlocal variable) at the entry and exit of the recursive function
3. Only ancestor nodes have the property where count (a nonlocal variable) is 0 on entry and 1 on exit!

Python3: nonlocal :notes:
The nonlocal statement causes the listed identifier to refer to previously 
bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding globals

root = Tree.BinaryTree(1)
root.insertLeft(2)
root.insertRight(3)
root.getLeft().insertLeft(4)
root.getLeft().insertRight(5)
root.getRight().insertLeft(6)
root.getRight().insertRight(7)


n1 = 4
print("Ancestors of nodes %d = %s" % (n1,common_ancestor(n1, root)))
