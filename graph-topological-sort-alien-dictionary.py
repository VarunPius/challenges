#Question: Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters in the language.

'''
REFERENCE:
http://www.elvisyu.com/alien-language-find-order-of-characters/#more-884

ALGORITHM:
Do following for every pair of adjacent words in given sorted array.
a) Let the current pair of words be word1 and word2. One by one compare characters of both words and find the first mismatching characters.
b) Create an edge in g from mismatching character of word1 to that of word2.

	size = len(graph)
	for i in range(0,size):
		w1 = a[i][0]
		if (i+1 < size):
			w2 = a[i+1][0]
		else:
			w2 = ""
		if (w1 != w2 and len(w2)> 0):
			graph[w1].append(w2)

	#	print(key,graph[key])
